# Java-Queue---Cheque-System
This assignment which was given for the Algorithmics DATA Structure concept was really very challenging and tough. But after analyzing and understanding each function and what it required as parameters, it was then possible to design and make it.
Still the main function was not successful as expected since I was not able to understand and implement although so much resources were available.
Time was very limited taking into consideration that as a working person in a much-demanded company where my presence is utmost important for urgent problematic solving and analysis. But still I was able to present a program instead of nothing.
The program required several JAVA chapters understandings where the acquired knowledge was very important to be applied. Overall, I am very pleased with the programing since I am at a very beginner level and I was

The program compromises of 2 main parts that is called by the main function.
• main( )
• Class Cheque
• Class ArrayList of Cheques (Queues Implemented)
The ArrayList is to be implemented in Generics.

Critical Appraisal
The main functions of the program were as follows:
1. Create an ArrayList
2. Use it as a Queue
3. Manipulate it as a Queue of Cheques using the Class Cheque
4. Class Cheque was created and parameters were designed for the class
5. Class ArrListQueue was created and parameters and functions were implemented as per guidelines provided.
6. Upon manipulation cheques were successfully created and also using a unique ID

Total Disaster functions Where I FAILED to Implement or Test.
1. search( )
• the above function was able not able to work and process data as I was supposed to. I tested and tried still a failure.
2. clone( )
• the above function was able not able to work and process data as I was supposed to. I tested and tried still a failure even after I tried other codes from the internet where it stated how to use the function.
3. compareTo ()
• this function was implemented automatically via the JAVA ide but again a huge headache to use the function and to test it. Total Failure from my part.
